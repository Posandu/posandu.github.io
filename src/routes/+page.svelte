		My programming journey started at the age of 11 when I learned some HTML and
		CSS. What was fun is that I learned everything without internet access,
		relying on self-motivation and determination! The joy I felt when my first
		website came to life is unforgettable.
	</p>

	<p class="{!expanded ? 'opacity-50' : ''} ">
		In 2020, I launched my own website, Tronic247, where I share programming
		knowledge through tutorials. I cover a wide range of topics, including HTML,
		CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, and PHP. My website attracts over
		100 unique visitors daily, and I'm grateful to share my passion and help
		others discover the joy of programming.

				In 2021, during the pandemic, I saw an opportunity to expand my skills
				further. I delved deep into JavaScript, CSS, React, and Svelte. My hard
				work paid off, and I'm now certified as better than 99% of JavaScript
				developers in problem-solving.
			</p>

			<p>
				Well, now it's 2023, and I'm a full-stack developer now üòÑ (but also a
				student). I'm currently intrested in LLM and AI stuff and mostly
				JavaScript. I made some IoT devices using NodeMCUs and Arduinos.

				Besides programming, I have other hobbies that keep me engaged. I love
				playing badminton, reading books, and solving puzzles.
