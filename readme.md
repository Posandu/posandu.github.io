# My Portfolio

A SvelteKit app. You're free to use this template, although credit is appreciated. If you do use this template, please let me know! I'd love to see what you make with it. 

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, edit code in `src/routes` and `src/lib`. You can start the dev server with:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

For the guestbook, you'll need to set up a Firebase project and edit the `src\routes\guestbook\+page.svelte` file. You'll need to add your Firebase config to the `firebaseConfig` variable.

Publish to Vercel or another host of your choice!

Profit?
